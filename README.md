# Creating-Contextually-Sales-Dialogues-Using-LLMs


## Project Overview
This project aims to generate a dataset of sales conversations using an LLM. The dataset is intended to reflect meaningful and diverse sales interactions, as inspired by the research paper "Let the LLMs Talk".

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script to generate the dataset: `python run.py`.

## Data Generation Process
The dataset is generated using a language model to simulate sales conversations. Each conversation is designed to be contextually relevant, coherent, and engaging, covering a variety of products and services.
